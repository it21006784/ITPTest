#### Brief Description of Project - The Online Travel Planning System is a web-based application that provides a platform for both tourists and service providers in the tourism industry. The system allows tourists to plan and book their trips online, while service providers can use it to manage their business operations. The client plans to convert their existing manual system to an online system. Due to the economic crisis, countries that depend on tourism, like Sri Lanka, have been greatly affected. The website offers a range of hotels and amenities for users to choose from, based on their budget. The website also aims to provide tourists with worry-free vacation options by avoiding overpricedÂ services.
